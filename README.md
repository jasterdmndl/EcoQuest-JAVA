# EcoQuest

EcoQuest is an educational game designed to teach players about proper waste management. In the game, you control a player (P) on a grid to collect trash (T) and deposit it into the correct bin (B). You must identify the type of trash: Nabubulok, Hindi Nabubulok, Recyclable, or Hazardous. Correct identifications increase your score and streak. Wrong ones reset them! The game features increasing difficulty with more trash as your streak grows. High scores are saved for future sessions. Developed as a fun way to learn about environmental responsibility.

## 🌱 Features

* **Interactive Gameplay**: Players explore, pick up items, and complete quests.
* **Quiz System**: Correct answers unlock progress.
* **Inventory Mechanics**: Items collected throughout the game are stored and used strategically.
